# easto

A static-site generator

## Run

Create the output: `node index.js`

Start a local webserver at http://localhost:8000/ :

    `cd output && caddy -p 8000`

I decided to try [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as my local webserver.

You can find a great list of simple servers at https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255 . Some of them are already available if you have Python or Ruby installed.
